# Movement-AI

To create and implement a decentralized AI behavior that governs all logic within the game, to stimulate faster decision making and cut down on compute cycles in a pre-existing compute-intensive environment.
In this project, our primary focus lied on movement of AI and how these objects interact with others, while under the control of the movement functions.
